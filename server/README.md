# File Uploader API

A robust NestJS API for managing file uploads to S3-compatible storage with queue management.

## Features

- RESTful API for file uploads
- Queue management to limit concurrent uploads (max 3 at a time)
- Integration with S3-compatible storage using AWS SDK v3 (AWS S3, DigitalOcean Spaces, Backblaze, etc.)
- File metadata stored in MongoDB
- API rate limiting for security
- Swagger API documentation

## Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB
- S3-compatible storage account

## Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# MongoDB Configuration
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/file-uploader

# AWS S3 Configuration
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
S3_ENDPOINT=https://s3.amazonaws.com  # Change for other S3-compatible services
```

## Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Development
npm run start:dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm run start:prod
```

## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/uploads/file` - Upload a single file
- `POST /api/uploads/files` - Upload multiple files (max 20 at once)
- `GET /api/uploads` - Get all files
- `DELETE /api/uploads/:id` - Delete a file

## Swagger Documentation

API documentation is available at `/api/docs` when the server is running.

## Implementation Details

- Files are uploaded to S3-compatible storage via queue
- Only 3 files are uploaded concurrently (configurable)
- Each file's metadata is stored in MongoDB
- Rate limiting is implemented to prevent abuse
- Uses AWS SDK v3 for improved performance, modularity and reduced bundle size
- Supports both standard S3 endpoints and custom endpoints
